# 🧠 MIPS32 Processor Design using Verilog

A custom implementation of a 32-bit MIPS processor using Verilog, simulating the instruction pipeline, ALU, memory interface, and control logic.

## 🚀 Features

- Supports I-type, R-type, and J-type instructions
- 5-stage pipeline: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback
- Hazard detection and forwarding
- Branch and jump instructions support
- Testbench with sample programs

## 📦 Tools Used

- **Verilog HDL**
- **Icarus Verilog** (for simulation)
- **GTKWave** (for waveform viewing)
- **VS Code + Verilog extension**

(A really amazing book to read)

## 📁 Project Structure

Within next to to three weeks we will try to design a MIPS32 processor which will include R,I and J type instructions and hazard detection and forwarding units.
The MIPS unlike x86 has a fixed length of instructions here 32 bits in length because of which there have to be different formats like R,I and J type.

Following are the set of instructions in MIPS we will not be including all be all the necessary once.
